// Description: 
// Roman to Integer

// Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

// Symbol       Value
// I             1
// V             5
// X             10
// L             50
// C             100
// D             500
// M             1000

// For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

// Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

// I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
// X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
// C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
// Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: s = "III"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: III = 3.
// Example 2:

// Input: s = "LVIII"
// Output: 58
// Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
// Example 3:

// Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
// Output: 1994
// Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
 

// Constraints:

// 1 <= s.length <= 15
// s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
// It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].

// My Solution:

function romanToInt(s) {
  const romanValues = {
    'I': 1,
    'V': 5,
    'X': 10,
    'L': 50,
    'C': 100,
    'D': 500,
    'M': 1000
  };

  let total = 0;

  for(let i = 0; i < s.length; i++){
    const current = romanValues[s[i]];
    const next = romanValues[s[i + 1]];

    if(current < next){
        total -= current
    }else {
        total += current
    }
  }
  return total
}

// My Explanation: We create an object romanValues to map each Roman numeral to its integer value. We initialize a total variable to keep track of the final integer value. We then iterate through each character in the string s. For each character, we get its value (current) and the value of the next character (next). If the current value is less than the next value, it means we need to subtract the current value from the total (as per Roman numeral rules). Otherwise, we add the current value to the total. Finally, we return the total after processing all characters in the string.
